Q&A
* How vizualize changed cells?
- Store state of map on previous cycle.
- Call map_update after instruction activation or *inside* function that affects map.

`live` instructions will make alive process regardless of whether bot id passed as
an argument exists. If it was executed successfully, it will glow in
COLOR_PAIR(13, COLOR_WHITE, get_bot_color_by_index) for 50 cycles
